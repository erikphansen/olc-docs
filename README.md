Our Little Community exists to help you manage your small HOA. Its design is deliberately simple but deceptively powerful. I built Our Little Community to be the nexus for all things related to my 32-home HOA. And it's what I would have wanted at my previous 12-unit condo. Perhaps it can work for your HOA, too.

If you cannot find what you are looking for in this guide, please [send me an email](mailto:erik@ourlittlecommunity.org).
