# Construction Mode

By default, Admins have the ability to edit site content that most users cannot. But when you need to edit content that _rarely_ needs to changed, it's time to turn on Construction Mode.

You'll need to turn on Construction Mode if you want to:

- Add/remove/edit community homes
- Add/remove/edit people associated with homes
- Add/remove/edit committees
- Add/remove/edit community spaces
- Remove committee requests
- Edit the community name
