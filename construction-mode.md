# Construction Mode

By default, Admins have the ability to add and edit site content that most users cannot. But when you need to edit parts of the site that _rarely_ change, it's time to turn on Construction Mode.

You can turn on Construction Mode from the main menu; it's hard to miss the big red button:

It'll be pretty obvious when you've turned on Construction Mode because this banner will be shown at the top of every page:

You'll need to turn on Construction Mode if you want to:

- Add/remove/edit community homes
- Add/remove/edit people associated with homes
- Add/remove/edit committees
- Add/remove/edit community spaces
- Remove committee requests
- Edit the community name
