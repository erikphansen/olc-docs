# The Directory

The directory lists all of the people who live in your community. The directory landing page lists each home with the names of each home's owner or owners. Click on any home's description to see the contact info for owners, renters, and emergency contacts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mailing addresses are considered private and are only visible to admins or that home's owners.
{% endhint %}

## Editing the Directory

Homeowners can edit the info associated with their own home. Site admins can edit the info associated with any home after they turn on Construction Mode.

**Nerdy Detail:** Homes in the directory are sorted in numeric order. Most of the time, this should "just work" how you'd expect it to. "Unit 3" will be listed before "Unit 11," for example. You can use this bit of knowledge to control the order in which homes appear. For example, if your community's homes are street addresses and you want "10 Elm Ave" to appear _after_ "55 Main St," you can prefix each home with a house number: "House 1 - 55 Main St" and "House 2 - 10 Elm Ave."
