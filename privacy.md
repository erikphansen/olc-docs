# Privacy and permissions

_All_ of the content associated with your community is _private_. That is, only logged-in members of your community can view anything related to your community.

Within each community there are three types of members:

- Most community members are **Homeowners**. They have access to most sections of the site. They can edit their own home's information in the directory, post requests, reserve shared community spaces, access documents and meeting minutes, etc.
- **Renters** have less access and fewer permissions than Homeowners. They can view the directory, reserve shared community spaces, and have limited access to documents.
- **Admins** have full access to the site and can also turn on Construction Mode.
