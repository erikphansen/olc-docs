# Privacy and permissions

_All_ of the content associated with your community is _private_. That is, only logged in members of your community can view your community.
Within each community there are three types of members:

- Most community members are **Homeowners**. They have access to most of the site's content and can edit their home's information in the Directory.
- **Renters** have less access and fewer permissions than Homeowners.
- **Admins** have full access to the site and can also turn on Construction Mode.
