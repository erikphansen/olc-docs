# Setting up your community

Before you can start using Our Little Community to help manage your community, you'll need to set up your community.

## First steps:

There are four initial steps to create the foundation of your community:

- [ ] [Create a new account](#create-a-new-account)
- [ ] [Create a new community](#create-a-new-community)
- [ ] [Add homes to your community](#add-homes-to-your-community)
- [ ] [Add community members](#add-community-members) (and invite them to join Our Little Community)

## Create a new account

There is a ["Sign up" link](https://app.ourlittlecommunity.org/users/sign_up) on the [Our Little Community log in page](https://app.ourlittlecommunity.org). Signing up simply requires a name and email address. Enter those and pick a password. That's all there is to it.

## Create a new community

After you have created an account, you'll be prompted to [set up a new community](https://app.ourlittlecommunity.org/communities/new). All you need to do is pick a name.

## Add homes to your community

After picking a name for your community you'll see the community landing page. At this point you _could_ start setting up whatever you want — adding documents, setting up committees, etc. — but I'd recommend that you start by adding homes to your community. There will be a handy "Start adding homes" link near the top of the page. Click that. You could also click the Directory link and then the "Add a new home" link.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't see the "Add a new home" link on the Directory page, turn on [Construction Mode]('construction-mode.md') from the main main.
{% endhint %}

Each home needs a simple description like a unit number or address. After each home you add, you'll be prompted to add another home.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Nerdy Detail:** Homes in the directory are sorted in numeric order. Most of the time, this should "just work" how you'd expect it to. "Unit 3" will be listed before "Unit 11," for example. You can use this bit of knowledge to control the order in which homes appear. For example, if your community's homes are street addresses and you want "10 Elm Ave" to appear _after_ "55 Main St," you can prefix each home with a house number: "House 1 - 55 Main St" and "House 2 - 10 Elm Ave."
{% endhint %}

## Add community members

When you are finished adding all of your community's homes, it's time to add the members of your community. 

1. From the directory page, click a home's description.
2. Click the "Add an owner" link

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't see the "Add an owner" link, turn on [Construction Mode]('construction-mode.md') from the main main.
{% endhint %}

3. Fill in the name and email address fields. Feel free to leave phone number and mailing address blank for now; those can be added later by either the home's owner or an admin.
4. Be sure to check the box to "Invite this person" to your community before clicking the "Add Owner" button.

Those are the steps to add and invite someone to your community. You don't have to do it all in one go if you've got a lot of people to add and invite.

Congratulations! I promise that adding homes and community members is the most tedious and time consuming thing you'll ever have to do on Our Little Community.
